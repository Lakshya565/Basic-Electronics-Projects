# Easy-Projects-To-Learn-Electronics
This repository contains all of the code that I used to learn about electronics components. Each project has its own dedicated component and code associated with it. Throughout my junior and senior year of high school, I developed many such projects, and it is constantly being updated throughout my time at UIUC.

All of these projects were made using the Arduino IDE and Super Starter Kit.
